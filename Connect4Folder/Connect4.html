            <b>How to play</b>
            <p>Connect 4 is a game that allows you to experience the pleasure of a strategic game against a friend. It works by dropping a red or yellow token into the grid. The goal of the game is to be the first to form a row of 4 tokens of your own color horizontally, vertically or diagonally. You can block your opponent's formation row.</p>
            <br>
            <p>To change the game mode (AI vs player or player vs player) you must select the game mode from the drop-down menu and click on the "Game on!" button. By default it is player vs player, and the player starts the game if it is player vs AI.</p>
